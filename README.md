#IPStack Demo Project

This project is using .NET Core (v.3.1) as back-end API in order
to fetch and store IP address information from https://ipstack.com/

##Notes:

This project already includes a local database file (MSSQLLocalDB)
and a json file with IP addresses (in SolutionItems folder) for you to experiment.

Swagger is included so you can easily try the API.
